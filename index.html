<h1 id="hello-there">Hello there</h1>
<p>Here I’ll post some of my simple works.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>My name is Patryk Liniewicz and I study astronomy at Jagiellonian Univeristy in Kraków, Poland. Oh right, I’m polish. Currently in my 3rd year and beginning to write my bachelor’s thesis.</p>
<p>My scientific interests currently are <em>stellar physics</em>, <em>cosmology</em> and <em>mathematics</em>, e.i. <em>Lie groups, differential forms and tensors</em></p>
<p>I’m not someone you would call a programmer. I personally use C, python and haskell. Also, sporadically I tend to look at fortran code (as astronomers are conservative in this case…).</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-actually-do">What do I actually do</h2>
<p>Currently I am 3rd seat at the NKSA UJ management. That’s our little Astronomy Student Circle (or something…). At the time of creating this site our activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>not much… there’s the pandemic after all;</li>
<li>besides, in November 2020 we will (have already finished) host Students Conference of Astronomy Circles <em>LIMITED ONLINE EDITION</em>;</li>
<li>periodically (at least we try to) we’re having a guest or one of our own giving a presentation about they interest;</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, I am also a member of Physics Student Circle as well as Mathematics &amp; Natural Sciences Student Circle. They are both great. Physicists have a coffee machine.</p>
<h2 id="future-content">Future content</h2>
<p>My plans include some simple astronomical code that I’m writting as I need it for my undergrad lab reports so, nothing special but it could be helpful for someone.</p>
