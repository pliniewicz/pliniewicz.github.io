<p>Here I’ll post some of my simple works.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I study astronomy at Jagiellonian Univeristy in Kraków, Poland. Currently in my 3rd year and beginning to write my bachelor’s thesis.</p>
<p>My scientific interests currently are <em>stellar physics</em>, <em>cosmology</em> and <em>mathematics</em>, e.i. <em>Lie groups, differential forms and tensors</em></p>
<p>I’m not someone you would call a programmer. I personally use C, python and haskell. Also, sporadically I tend to look at fortran code (as astronomers are conservative in this case…).</p>
<h2 id="future-content">Future content</h2>
<p>My plans include some simple astronomical code that I’m writting as I need it for my undergrad lab reports so, nothing special but it could be helpful for someone.</p>
