Here I'll post some of my simple works.


## About me

I study astronomy at Jagiellonian Univeristy in Krak√≥w, Poland. Currently in my 3rd year and beginning to write my bachelor's thesis.

My scientific interests currently are *stellar physics*, *cosmology* and *mathematics*, e.i. *Lie groups, differential forms and tensors* 

I'm not someone you would call a programmer. I personally use C, python and haskell. Also, sporadically I tend to look at fortran code (as astronomers are conservative in this case...). 

## Future content

My plans include some simple astronomical code that I'm writting as I need it for my undergrad lab reports so, nothing special but it could be helpful for someone.
