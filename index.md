# Hello there

Here I'll post some of my simple works.

## About me

My name is Patryk Liniewicz and I study astronomy at Jagiellonian Univeristy in Krak√≥w, Poland. 
Oh right, I'm polish.
Currently in my 3rd year and beginning to write my bachelor's thesis.

My scientific interests currently are *stellar physics*, *cosmology* and *mathematics*, e.i. *Lie groups, differential forms and tensors* 

I'm not someone you would call a programmer. I personally use C, python and haskell.
Also, sporadically I tend to look at fortran code (as astronomers are conservative in this case...). 

## What do I actually do

Currently I am 3rd seat at the NKSA UJ management.
That's our little Astronomy Student Circle (or something...). 
At the time of creating this site our activities include:

- not much... there's the pandemic after all;
- besides, in November 2020 we will (have already finished) host Students Conference of Astronomy Circles *LIMITED ONLINE EDITION*;
- periodically (at least we try to) we're having a guest or one of our own giving a presentation about they interest;

Besides, I am also a member of Physics Student Circle as well as Mathematics & Natural Sciences Student Circle. 
They are both great.
Physicists have a coffee machine.

## Future content

My plans include some simple astronomical code that I'm writting as I need it for my undergrad lab reports so, nothing special but it could be helpful for someone.
